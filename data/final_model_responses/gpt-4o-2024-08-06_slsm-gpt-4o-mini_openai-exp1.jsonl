Leaf spots can be caused by a variety of factors, but here are some common possibilities to consider:\n\n1. **Fungal Infections**: Often appear as small, dark spots. Ensure good air circulation and avoid overhead watering to prevent moisture buildup.\n\n2. **Bacterial Infections**: These can cause water-soaked spots that may turn brown. Remove affected leaves and improve air circulation.\n\n3. **Pests**: Check for signs of insects like aphids or spider mites, which can cause damage. You might see tiny holes or webbing.\n\n4. **Nutrient Deficiencies**: Yellowing or browning spots can indicate a lack of nutrients. Consider using a balanced fertilizer.\n\n5. **Watering Issues**: Overwatering or underwatering can stress plants, leading to leaf spots. Ensure your containers have good drainage and adjust your watering schedule.\n\n6. **Sunburn**: If plants are getting too much direct sunlight, they might develop spots. Consider providing some shade during peak sun hours.\n\nTo narrow it down, you might want to:\n- Inspect the leaves closely for pests or signs of infection\n- Review your watering and fertilizing routine\n- Consider recent changes in sunlight exposure\n\nIf you can provide more details about the spots or any recent changes in your plant care routine, I can help you troubleshoot further!"}

Here's a brief comparison to clarify:\n\n### Broomstick Lace:\n- **Technique**: Broomstick lace involves using a large knitting needle, dowel, or \"broomstick\" to hold loops of yarn, which are then worked off in groups with single crochet stitches.\n- **Appearance**: This technique creates a lacy, open fabric with distinctive loops that form a pattern resembling elongated ovals or teardrops.\n- **Structure**: The pattern you provided involves pulling up loops onto the broomstick and then working them off in groups of four with single crochet stitches. This creates a series of lace-like columns.\n\n### Shell Stitch:\n- **Technique**: The shell stitch is created by working multiple stitches (usually double crochets) into a single stitch or space, forming a fan or shell shape.\n- **Appearance**: Shell stitch creates a scalloped, textured pattern that looks like overlapping shells or fans.\n- **Structure**: Typically, shell stitch patterns involve working a set number of double crochets into one stitch, skipping a few stitches, and then repeating the shell pattern across the row.\n\nWhile both stitches can involve groups of stitches, the broomstick lace is characterized by its use of loops and a broomstick tool, whereas the shell stitch is defined by its fan-like clusters of stitches. Each technique offers a unique texture and style, making them both wonderful options for different types of projects.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"}

Since you mentioned you're a big guy and prefer weights above 30 kg, here's a general guideline for progression:\n\n1. **Starting Weight**: Begin with a weight that you can lift for 8-12 repetitions with good form. If you're comfortable with weights above 30 kg, you might start with 30-40 kg for compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses. For smaller muscle groups or isolation exercises, you might start with 15-25 kg.\n\n2. **Progression Plan**:\n   - **Week 1-2**: Focus on mastering your form and getting comfortable with the starting weight. Perform 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps for each exercise.\n   - **Week 3-4**: If you can comfortably complete 12 reps with good form, increase the weight by 2.5-5 kg for upper body exercises and 5-10 kg for lower body exercises. Continue with 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps.\n   - **Week 5-6**: Continue to increase the weight as you become stronger, following the same incremental increases. Ensure you're still able to perform 8-12 reps with good form.\n   - **Week 7-8**: By this time, you should be lifting weights that are 5-10 kg heavier for upper body exercises and 10-20 kg heavier for lower body exercises compared to your starting weight.\n\n3. **Listening to Your Body**: It's crucial to listen to your body and avoid pushing through pain. If you experience discomfort or struggle to maintain form, reduce the weight or take a rest day.\n\n4. **Rest and Recovery**: Allow for adequate rest between workouts, especially for the same muscle groups, to promote recovery and growth.\n\n5. **Consult a Professional**: Consider working with a personal trainer to ensure proper form and to tailor the progression plan to your specific needs and goals.\n\nRemember, progression in weightlifting is not just about increasing the weight but also about improving form, control, and endurance."}
