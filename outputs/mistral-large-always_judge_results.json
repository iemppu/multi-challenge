It also highlights the disparity in how different acts of theft are perceived based on power dynamics and systemic issues, rather than maintaining a clear-cut moral condemnation of theft in all situations.\n\nTherefore, the model response does not meet the criteria of maintaining a moral judgment that lying and stealing are wrong, no matter the circumstances.",
